# Mini-Golf

The project is an immersive golf video game. 

We are using different devices to create this game: two touch screens (one for launching the game and showing scores and another screen to help users when they are playing), an overhead projector to project the game track on the floor, one kinect to detect user orientation, one sphero to simulate the ball and one smartphone by players to golf club. 

You can see in this git repository several folders with specific functionality:
- AndroidGolfClub : Contains the program for the smartphone application.
- BackEnd: Contains the server program.
- FrontEnd: Contains the program for all the touch screens and the game track interface.
- Sphero: Contains the little server for the sphero
- kinect: Contains the program for the Kinect

In each folder you will find a README.md with instructions to install everything needed to run the application.
